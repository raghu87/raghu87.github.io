benefits of call divert

if you have single sim phone. and you want to use 2nd one instead of airtel number. if insert new without call forwarding from old airtel number. you loose your callers.
in my case call cost in airtel very high using since 7 years. but I got telenor Sim free of cost. 28 days telenor to telenor unlimited talk time. and 25p/minute for all mobiles.
and I converted all airtel calls to minor no need to insert airtel number until the free balance of minor completes.
2nd benefit if you have no phone due to some maintenance or repair.
and all other benefits for funny diverting to your friends.

Call divert & forwarding charges: Generally every minute of forward call charges as an outgoing call, some carriers charges 1-3 Rupees for 1 minute.
So call forwarding is not free.

if you want to use new Sim instead of old sim. or the old sim for incoming and new sim for out going for a long time.

make sure to use old SIM once in 90 days for outgoing calls or text, or data usage. to avoid deactivation of the number.
